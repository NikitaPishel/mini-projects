# Times 2 API
1-day project where I create a server based on Flask, then I launch some HTTP requests in unit test to see if the output is expected. First route "/multiply" should return number given multiplied by 2.

Second route "/radius" isn't tested by unittest, but accepts floating point numbers and return an area of a circle with a given radius.
